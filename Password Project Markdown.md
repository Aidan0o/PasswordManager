Password Project Updates file:

Goals:
The goal of the project is to create a password manager for a company. We will be achieving this through a combination of a SQL database that can be accessed using a username and password and a front end made in OpenFrameworks and C++. Further information can be found in the Meeting Outcomes and writeup document.


Meeting Outcomes:
Meeting 1:
During the first meeting we worked out the general set up of the project such as the usage of hashing algorithms to encrypt the passwords to access the database and the encryption of the database until a user logs in by using their unique employee ID as an encryption key. As well as that, it was decided that the project would be formatted in a long chain of Agile sprints. We also decided who would be assigned what work for the first week, as will be viewable in the Trello document.
